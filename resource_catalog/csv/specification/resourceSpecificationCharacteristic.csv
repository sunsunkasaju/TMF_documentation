field name,description
@valueSchemaLocation, "A string. This (optional) field provides a link to the schema describing the value type."
configurable, "A boolean. If true, the Boolean indicates that the ResourceSpecCharacteristic is configurable."
description, "A string. A narrative that explains the CharacteristicSpecification."
extensible, "A boolean. An indicator that specifies that the values for the characteristic can be extended by adding new values when instantiating a characteristic for a resource."
id, "A string. Unique ID for the characteristic."
isUnique, "A boolean. An indicator that specifies if a value is unique for the specification. Possible values are; 'unique while value is in effect' and 'unique whether value is in effect or not'."
maxCardinality, "An integer. The maximum number of instances a CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone numbers in a group calling plan, where five is the value for the maxCardinality."
minCardinality, "An integer. The minimum number of instances a CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone numbers in a group calling plan, where zero is the value for the minCardinality."
name, "A string. A word, term, or phrase by which this characteristic specification is known and distinguished from other characteristic specifications."
regex, "A string. A rule or principle represented in regular expression used to derive the value of a characteristic value."
resourceSpecCharRelationship, "A list of resource specification characteristic relationships (ResourceSpecificationCharacteristicRelationship [*]). An aggregation, migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship between/among Specification Characteristics."
resourceSpecCharacteristicValue, "A list of resource specification characteristic values (ResourceSpecificationCharacteristicValue [*]). A ResourceSpecificationCharacteristicValue object is used to define a set of attributes, each of which can be assigned to a corresponding set of attributes in a ResourceSpecificationCharacteristic object. The values of the attributes in the ResourceSpecificationCharacteristicValue object describe the values of the attributes that a corresponding ResourceSpecificationCharacteristic object can take on."
validFor, "A time period. The period of time for which a characteristic is applicable."
valueType, "A string. A kind of value that the characteristic can take on, such as numeric, text and so forth."
